#v0.2.2
- Bugfix: Config should not clobber `ember try:ember` arguments

#v0.2.1
- Feature: Ability for addons to set Ember compatibility in a key in `package.json` to run against many Ember versions, see README.
- Feature: New command `ember try:ember <semver-range>`, runs specified command for each Ember verson in the semver range
- Feature: New command `ember try:config`, shows the config that `ember-try` will run with
- Feature: Config file can now export a function that will receive the ember-cli project as a variable
- Feature: Output header at the top of each scenario run to make output easier to parse

#v0.2.0
- Feature: New command `ember try:one <scenario-name>`, replacement for `ember try <scenario-name>` with different command line signature to better accommodate passing options to the command that is run.
- Feature: New command `ember try:each`, replacement for `ember try:testall`, but with a better name for what it can now do. 
- Feature: New configuration option, `command`, top level and within each scenario to set the command that wil be used by `ember-try`.
- Feature: New configuration option, per scenario, `allowedToFail`. If set, `ember-try` will not fail the overall command if the scenario fails.
- Feature: New configuration options, `bowerOptions` and `npmOptions`; these are passed to `bower` and `npm`, respectively, when used by `ember-try`.
- Deprecation: `ember try <scenario-name>` command is deprecated and replaced with `ember try:one <scenario-name>`
- Deprecation: `ember try:testall` command is deprecated and replaced with `ember try:each`.

  env var

#v0.0.5
- Pass through arguments to commands (allows `ember try ember-canary test --server`)
- `--skip-cleanup` option for commands `try` and `try:testall` to not restore the default bower dependency set. This is useful in CI environments when the build is being thrown out and not deployed.
