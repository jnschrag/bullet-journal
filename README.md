# bullet-journal
A personal project to develop a digital version of the [bullet journal system](bulletjournal.com). I've used the analog system for a few months and enjoy it, but would benefit from being able to convert it to digital. I am also going to challenge myself by creating this in a technology I am unfamiliar with as a way of learning a new library or framework for development. I will be working on this project as a part of the [#100DaysOfCommits](https://medium.com/@WomenWhoCodeDC/100-days-of-commits-60af0abe8825#.nl8bdz2iz) and [Women Who Code DC](https://twitter.com/WomenWhoCodeDC).
